# Milestone Project 1 | Mike Payton Storytelling Services

The project is a profile website on Mike Payton, Storyteller and the services he offers at events, schools and
the community to enrich peoples imagination with his Storytelling.

The project is also to highlight his company "BeHeard" which is a support service that assists business owners in making 
successful presentations thorugh creative narrative. 

## UX

The website is to highlight Mike's services as a Storyteller.
I have used an image as the primary theme of a group around a camp fire to denote a cosy storytelling atmosphere within the website. 

I have used orange hovers / assets and text in place to balance the warmth of the fire throught the website.
